# Pokemon App ðŸŽ‰
This project allows user to end the name of their favorite pokemon and then it generates the pokemon card for them. I've made this project in Nex.js and used Framer Motion for animations.

The pokemon-app is deployed on Vercel you can view it here
[*pokemon-app*](https://pokemon-app-one-pi.vercel.app/)

## _Run the project_

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` 

To install all the packages first, we are using flag --legacy-peer-deps because I am using a package, that gives me the color from the image file, so I can have dynamic color for my pokemon cards ðŸ˜¸

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
